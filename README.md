# FantasyFootballDash

This was the first attempt at building a dashboard in Dash using fantasy football data found on Reddit.

Data source: https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/8y0298/heres_a_spreadsheet_with_10_years_of_fantasy_data/
Heroku Dashboard: https://fantasyfootballdash.herokuapp.com/

TODO:
  1. Work on mobile friendliness
  2. Aquire "live fantasy football data"
  3. Add more insights
